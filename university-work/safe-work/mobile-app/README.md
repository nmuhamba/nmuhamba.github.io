# Using Expo for the Mobile Application
Expo is an open-source platform that makes it easier to build and run React Native applications. It provides a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help developers build, test, and deploy mobile apps quickly â€” without needing to directly touch native code.

For more info, please visit [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

# Getting Started with the Mobile Application
Please ensure that you have Node.js and Expo CLI installed:

- npm install -g expo-cli

Install all of the dependencies:

- npm install

To run the mobile application, do the following:

- Download Expo Go on your mobile device.

- cd mobile-app
- npx expo start -c
- Scan the QR code. This will run the app on Expo Go.

Alternatively, if you have an iOS simulator or Android Emulator/ Android Studio on your device, you can use the simulators by running the commands: i for iOS Simulator or a for Android Emulator.
